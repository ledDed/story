But when a letter arrived offering him temporary work in a distant city, John knew he couldn’t refuse. His family needed the money, and the city promised opportunity.He packed his bag at dawn, hugged his mother goodbye, and set off on foot. The road to the city wound through dense, ancient woods—a shortcut,  the villagers said, but one few dared to take after dark. John, determined   to reach the city before nightfall, pressed on beneath the towering trees.    Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the mossy ground and filling     the air with the scent of pine and earth.As he walked, the forest grew wilder. The path narrowed, roots twisted underfoot, and the silence deepened. Hours passed. John’s thoughts drifted between home and the unknown  city ahead, until something strange caught his eye: a moss-covered stone arch, half-buried in the undergrowth, pulsing with a faint blue light.Curiosity overcame caution. John stepped closer, brushed aside the vines, and, heart pounding, crossed the threshold.The world convulsed. The air turned to ice, then fire. John’s vision blurred as the ground vanished beneath his feet. He tumbled through a suffocating darkness, the sound of distant screams echoing in his ears. The smell of sulfur and rot filled his lungs. When he finally landed, it was on scorched, cracked earth that burned through his boots.He staggered to his feet. The sky above was a swirling mass of blood-red clouds, lit by flashes of sickly green lightning. Rivers of molten rock snaked through the landscape, casting a hellish glow on twisted, skeletal trees. Shadows moved in the corners of his vision—shapes that slithered, crawled, and leapt, their eyes glinting with hunger.A cacophony of wails and guttural laughter rose around him. Demons, grotesque and nightmarish, emerged from the gloom. Their skin was slick and black, their mouths filled with jagged teeth. They circled John, their claws scraping the ground, their voices whispering promises of pain.One demon lunged, claws outstretched. John braced for the end—when a voice, smooth as silk and cold as winter, sliced through the chaos:“Stand aside. This one is mine.”The demons froze, their snarls fading into uneasy silence. From the shadows, a figure emerged—tall, elegant, and wreathed in a darkness deeper than the rest. Lucifer’s eyes glowed with an ancient intelligence, and a faint, unsettling smile played on his lips.He circled John, inspecting him as one might a curious artifact. “A mortal, wandering so far from home,” Lucifer mused. “You must be either very brave, or very foolish.”John could barely breathe. The air around Lucifer seemed to hum with power and menace.Lucifer leaned in, his voice dropping to a whisper that echoed in John’s mind. “You do not belong here, yet here you are. The rules of this place are clear—no soul leaves without a price.He straightened, addressing both John and the watching demons. “But I am not without mercy. I will grant you your life, John. In exchange, you will owe me three tasks. These will not be simple errands, nor will you know when I will call upon you. When the time comes, you must obey—no matter the cost, no matter the danger. Refuse, and your soul will remain here, in my realm, for all eternity.”The demons hissed in disappointment, but none dared challenge Lucifer’s decree. John, trembling, nodded, his voice barely a whisper. “I accept.”Lucifer’s smile widened, both reassuring and terrifying. “Good. Our bargain is sealed. Remember, John—hell never forgets a debt.”In a blink, John was back in the woods, the portal gone. The forest seemed unchanged, but John knew his life never would be. Somewhere, someday, the devil would come to collect."
